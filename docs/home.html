        <p><b>What's unhealthy?</b><br><br>We usually eat anything that we see without regarding it's healthiness. Under- or overeating, not eating enough of the healthy foods we need each day, or consuming too many types of food and drink that are low in fiber or heavy in fat, salt, and/or sugar are all examples of poor eating habits. <br><br>Poor nutrition can affect our daily health and wellness, as well as our capacity to enjoy and participate in activities. <br>Poor nutrition can contribute to stress, fatigue, and our ability to function in the short term, and it can also contribute to the likelihood of acquiring certain illnesses and other health problems over time.</p>

        <br><br><p><b>Eating a healthy diet</b><br><br>Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day. You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including veggies in your meal; eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</p>

        <br><br><p><b>Example of eating/drinking healthy</b><br><br>As an example, fruit shakes are a good way to live healthy as they are fruit and enjoyable to drink.</p>

        <br><br><p><b>Some tips when eating</b></p>

        <br><br><p><b>Don’t fear coffee</b><br><br>Coffee is very healthy. It’s high in antioxidants, and studies have linked coffee intake to longevity and a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and numerous other illnesses.</p>
        <img src="img/coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee" class="responsive">

        <br><br><p><b>Get enough sleep</b><br><br>The importance of getting enough quality sleep cannot be overstated. Poor sleep can drive insulin resistance, disrupt your appetite hormones, and reduce your physical and mental performance. What’s more, poor sleep is one of the strongest individual risk factors for weight gain and obesity. One study linked insufficient sleep to an 89% and 55% increased risk of obesity in children and adults, respectively.</p>
        <img src="img/sleep.jpg" alt="Sleep" class="responsive">

        <br><br><p><b>Drink some water, especially before meals</b><br><br>Drinking enough water can have numerous benefits. Surprisingly, it can boost the number of calories you burn. Two studies note that it can increase metabolism by 24–30% over 1–1.5 hours. This can amount to 96 additional calories burned if you drink 8.4 cups (2 liters) of water per day. The optimal time to drink it is before meals. One study showed that downing 2.1 cups (500 ml) of water 30 minutes before each meal increased weight loss by 44%.</p>
        <img src="img/water.jpg" alt="Water" class="responsive">

        <br><br><p><b>Don’t overcook or burn your meat</b><br><br>Meat can be a nutritious and healthy part of your diet. It’s very high in protein and contains various important nutrients. However, problems occur when meat is overcooked or burnt. This can lead to the formation of harmful compounds that raise your risk of cancer. When you cook meat, make sure not to overcook or burn it.</p>
        <img src="img/meat.jpg" alt="meat" class="responsive">

        <br><br><p><b>Avoid bright lights before sleep</b><br><br>When you’re exposed to bright lights in the evening, it may disrupt your production of the sleep hormone melatonin. One strategy is to use a pair of amber-tinted glasses that block blue light from entering your eyes in the evening. This allows melatonin to be produced as if it were completely dark, helping you sleep better.</p>
        <img src="img/light.jpg" alt="Light" class="responsive">

        <br><br><p><b>Eat vegetables and fruits</b><br><br>Vegetables and fruits are loaded with prebiotic fiber, vitamins, minerals, and many antioxidants, some of which have potent biological effects. Studies show that people who eat the most vegetables and fruits live longer and have a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and other illnesses.</p>
        <img src="img/veg.jpg" alt="veg" class="responsive">

        <br><br><p><b>Minimize your sugar intake</b><br><br>Added sugar is one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet, as large amounts can harm your metabolic health. High sugar intake is linked to numerous ailments, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and many forms of cancer.</p>
        <img src="img/sugar.jpg" alt="Sugar" class="responsive">

        <br><br><br><b>Last Tip</b><br><p>A few simple steps can go a long way toward improving your diet and wellness.
            Still, if you’re trying to live a healthier life, don’t just focus on the foods you eat. Exercise, sleep, and social relationships are also important.
            With the tips above, it’s easy to get your body feeling great every day.</p>

            <br><br><br><b>Reflections</b>
            <p>
                1. My family responded to the challenge poorly only 1-2 members were able to succesfully follow the plan given <br>
                2. Maintaining a balanced nutrition is important as that will keep the family healthy and give them a healthy life <br>
                3. My nutritional program promote care because I made it for others too use and be able to follow it. <br>
                4. I'll sustain this program by following it everyday which means I'll make a schedule too follow that will include this program.
